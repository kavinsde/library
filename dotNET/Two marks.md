1. Inheritance in VB.NET is a feature that allows a class to inherit properties, methods, and events from another class. The inheriting class (child/derived class) can reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of the base class (parent class). In VB.NET, inheritance is implemented using the "Inherits" keyword.
    
2. Attributes in VB.NET are declarative tags that add metadata to your code. They provide additional information about assemblies, classes, methods, properties, etc. Attributes are enclosed in square brackets and can modify the behavior of elements at runtime or provide information to tools during development.
    
3. The two main types of events in VB.NET are:
    

- Synchronous events: Execute immediately when raised and block code execution until handled
- Asynchronous events: Allow the program to continue execution while the event is being processed

4. Difference between checkbox and radio buttons:

- Checkboxes allow multiple selections (can select multiple options simultaneously)
- Radio buttons allow only one selection from a group (mutually exclusive)

5. CLR (Common Language Runtime) is the execution environment of the .NET Framework. It manages memory, thread execution, code execution, security, and other system services. It also provides features like type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, and cross-language integration.
    
6. Standard controls of ASP.NET include TextBox, Label, Button, CheckBox, RadioButton, DropDownList, ListBox, DataGrid, DataList, Repeater, Panel, PlaceHolder, and validation controls like RequiredFieldValidator.
    
7. Controls in ASP.NET are server-side components that generate HTML to be rendered on the client browser. They encapsulate functionality and user interface elements, maintain state between requests, and respond to client-side events through postbacks, simplifying web application development.
    
8. Differences between DataSet and DataReader:
    

- DataSet is a disconnected, in-memory cache of data that can hold multiple tables, while DataReader is a connected, forward-only, read-only stream of data
- DataSet allows navigation in any direction and modification of data, while DataReader only allows forward-only reading of data
- DataSet consumes more memory but enables offline operations, while DataReader is more memory-efficient but requires an open connection

9. ADO.NET is a set of classes in the .NET Framework that provides data access services. It allows applications to connect to various data sources, retrieve, manipulate, and update data. ADO.NET separates data access from data manipulation through a disconnected architecture.
    
10. Expansions: (i) ASP.NET: Active Server Pages .NET (ii) ADO.NET: ActiveX Data Objects .NET (iii) ODBC: Open Database Connectivity (iv) OLEDB: Object Linking and Embedding Database
